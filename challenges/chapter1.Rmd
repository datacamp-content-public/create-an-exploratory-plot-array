Creating an exploratory plot array
In this exercise, you'll construct a simple exploratory plot from a data frame that gives values for three variables, recorded over two winter heating seasons. The variables are:

Temp: a measure of the outside temperature during one week
Gas: the amount of heating gas consumed during that week
Insul: a categorical variable with two values, indicating whether the measurements were made before or after an insulation upgrade was made to the house
